["# Markdown Reference and Test Page","Markdown is a simple and universal syntax for text formatting. More and more writers switch to markdown, because they can format their text during the writing process without using any format-buttons. Once they are familiar with the markdown syntax, they can write formatted text much easier and faster than with any standard HTML-editor.","Developers love markdown, because it is much cleaner and saver than HTML. And they can easily convert markdown to a lot of other document formats like HTML and others.","If you develop a theme for TYPEMILL, please take care that all elements on this page are designed properly.","## Table of Contents","To create a table of contents, simply write `[TOC]` in a separate line.
